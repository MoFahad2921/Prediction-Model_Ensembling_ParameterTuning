Prediction‑Model_Ensembling_ParameterTuning

Machine Learning Models with Ensembling & Hyperparameter Tuning
for Trend Monitoring and Forecasting (Sales Prediction)

This repository contains work focused on prediction modeling — combining different algorithms (ensembling) and fine‑tuning model parameters to build more accurate forecasting models, especially applied to sales trend analysis and forecasting. 
GitHub

🚀 Project Overview

Predictive modeling plays a key role in understanding and forecasting future trends in data such as sales, demand, or similar time‑dependent targets. This project explores:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Building prediction models

Ensembling techniques to boost performance

Parameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search)

Evaluation of forecasting performance

The primary implementation is in a Jupyter Notebook.

🔧 Key Techniques

The project demonstrates:
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Feature Engineering
✔️ Model Training & Validation
✔️ Model Ensembling (e.g., stacking, bagging, boosting)
✔️ Hyperparameter Tuning (automated search to optimize performance)
✔️ Performance Evaluation Metrics

(Specific models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or others may be included — add details here based on your notebook.)

📋 Usage
Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7+). Install dependencies such as:

pip install numpy pandas scikit‑learn matplotlib seaborn


(Add other libraries like XGBoost, LightGBM, etc., if used.)

Running the Notebook

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MoFahad2921/Prediction‑Model_Ensembling_ParameterTuning.git


Navigate into the folder:

cd Prediction‑Model_Ensembling_ParameterTuning


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook DataMining_FA.ipynb


Follow the notebook cells to reproduce analysis, training, and results.

📈 Results

(Fill in with summary of key metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, improvements from ensembling, etc. — once known.)

Example (template):

Model	Validation RMSE	Notes
Model A	✨0.82	Baseline
Model B	✨0.76	Tuned
Ensemble Model	⭐0.71	Best performance
